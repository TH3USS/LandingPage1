## About the Project

Hi, I'm Matheus ðŸ‘‹<br>
This project was created to put into practice concepts learned in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.
The goal of this project was to build an attractive and functional landing page, with animations that enhance the user experience and the addition of a dark mode for greater customization.

> This project was developed as a way to improve my skills in web design, animations, and interactivity.
